# BACKGROUND AND GRADIENTS

> Learning how to use background gradients in a page.

![screenshot](assets/images/screenshot.PNG)

Working on this project, I cloned an old apple page that displayed a navbar with a beautiful three toned background color. I was able to achieve this look by using a css property (gradient), precisely a linear gradient to give three similar colors (with slight differences when put side by side) with a 50% value: This means one color starts and stops when it reaches 50% of the element vertically and the other color continues to give that element a nice three toned look.
